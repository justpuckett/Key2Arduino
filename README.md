# Key2Arduino
Allows controlling Arduino relays from windows system key presses via a key listener. 

This program (still in development) is designed to allow the user to trigger Arduino relays via a specified key combination on a Windows system. 

The concept for this program was to allow a Twitch streamer to use his Streamlabs API to trigger a key combination on his system that'd trigger a relay that'd cause some device in his office to activate. For example, the Arduino relay could wired to the button of a candy dispenser.
